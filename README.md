# 🌍 Global Energy Trends Analysis | Power BI Dashboard Project

## 📊 Project Title:

**"Global Energy Trends: A Comprehensive Analysis of Key Regions and Generation Modes using Power BI"**

## 📁 About the Project

This project is the final outcome of my internship under the **SkillInternz Program**, where I dived deep into the global energy landscape by analyzing renewable and non-renewable power generation trends across continents and countries from 1990 to 2020. The insights are powered by data visualizations and interactive dashboards built in Power BI.

With energy consumption on the rise and the growing push toward sustainability, this project visualizes how countries and continents are adapting to renewable sources, and how their strategies differ based on geography, resource availability, and policy.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

* Analyze the power generation patterns of the top 20 energy-consuming countries.
* Compare renewable vs. non-renewable energy generation trends.
* Visualize the evolution of energy consumption from 1990 to 2020.
* Provide strategic insights for energy sustainability and regional energy planning.

## 📚 Project Flow

1. **🔹 Data Collection**

   * Sourced from Kaggle and loaded into Power BI.

2. **🔹 Data Preparation**

   * Cleaned, transformed, and structured for visual analytics.
   * Nulls removed, decimals rounded, columns unpivoted.

3. **🔹 Data Visualization**

   * Multiple dashboards built for countries, continents, and energy sources.
   * KPIs displayed using interactive cards, maps, and line/column/pie charts.

4. **🔹 Dashboard Design**

   * Fully responsive dashboards with slicers for Year, Country, and Continent.
   * Power generation from Solar, Hydro, Biofuel, and Geothermal shown via cards and maps.

5. **🔹 Report Narrative**

   * Written analysis of key findings like Asia being the top energy consumer and the positive correlation between biofuel and geothermal energy.

6. **🔹 Performance Testing**

   * Measures such as `AVERAGEX`, filters, and calculated columns used for optimized performance.

7. **🔹 Project Demonstration**
